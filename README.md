# bls-run

A decentralized blockchain-based governance framework for community-driven organizations, enabling transparent and secure collective decision-making.

## Overview

BLS-Run is a comprehensive governance system built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain, designed to provide flexible and secure governance mechanisms for decentralized communities. The platform enables member verification, proposal creation and management, democratic voting, and resource allocation while maintaining high standards of transparency and security.

## Core Components

### Membership Registry
- Manages member lifecycle including applications, verification, and role assignment
- Supports multiple member roles (Patient, Provider, Admin)
- Handles membership renewals and terminations
- Maintains secure registry of members and permissions

### Proposal Management
- Enables creation and management of healthcare-specific proposals
- Supports multiple proposal categories (Facility Improvement, Care Protocol, etc.)
- Handles proposal lifecycle from draft to execution
- Includes privacy controls for sensitive healthcare information

### Voting Engine
- Implements multiple voting mechanisms:
  - Simple majority voting
  - Quadratic voting
  - Role-weighted voting
- Supports vote delegation
- Ensures secure and auditable voting process
- Includes privacy protections for sensitive decisions

### Treasury Controller
- Manages cooperative financial resources
- Handles fund allocations and distributions
- Tracks recurring expenses
- Includes emergency fund provisions
- Maintains transparent audit trail

## Smart Contracts

### membership-registry
Manages the membership lifecycle and access control within the DAO.

Key features:
- Member application and verification process
- Role-based access control
- Membership status tracking
- Vote weight calculation based on roles

### proposal-manager
Handles the creation and lifecycle of governance proposals.

Key features:
- Multiple proposal categories for healthcare needs
- Privacy controls for sensitive information
- Proposal sponsorship system
- Complete proposal lifecycle management

### voting-engine
Implements the voting mechanisms and vote tracking system.

Key features:
- Multiple voting mechanisms
- Vote delegation capability
- Role-weighted voting power
- Privacy protections for sensitive votes

### treasury-controller
Manages the cooperative's financial resources.

Key features:
- Transparent fund management
- Emergency fund provisions
- Recurring expense handling
- Complete transaction audit trail

## Getting Started

To interact with the Pulse DAO:

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize the treasury controller with governance parameters
3. Register initial admin members
4. Configure voting mechanisms and weights
5. Begin proposal creation and voting process

## Security Considerations

- Member verification ensures only authorized participants can vote
- Privacy controls protect sensitive healthcare information
- Multi-signature requirements for emergency fund access
- Complete audit trail for all financial transactions
- Role-based access control for administrative functions

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain.
